This Application can be your personal fitness/calisthenics guide, especially in the current situation where all the gyms are closed.

First, you will see 3 buttons when you open the application.

With clicking on the first plan you will find a guide for training your whole body. Name of the exercise and on the right how many repetitions
you shall do. Also, you can see what muscles are focused on with this exercise. By clicking on the list item, a picture will appear 
in which you can see how to perform the exercise.
	
The second button will bring you to a YouTube Video where you can see a High Intensity Interval Training for your Cardio Days.

In the third button you will find Google Maps implemented so you can search for a Calisthenics Park, especially needed if you do not have 
a pull up bar, or something else needed for calisthenics, at home.
